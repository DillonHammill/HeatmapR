**HeatmapR** it a lightweight R package that makes it easy to generate high quality heatmaps with minimal data preprocessing or manual customization. Visit the **HeatmapR** website to get started https://dillonhammill.github.io/HeatmapR/.

## Availabe Packages for Heatmaps

- heatmap() in the stats package
- [qplots](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html)
- [superheat](https://github.com/rlbarter/superheat)
- [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2)
- [plotly](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly)
- [ComplexHeatmap](https://github.com/jokergoo/ComplexHeatmap)

## Benefits of HeatmapR
`HeatmapR` has a number of benefits over other heatmap packages:

* **HeatmapR** is built using base graphics, so there is no required `ggplot2` knowledge in order to use this package.
* **HeatmapR** is extremely lighweight and therefore there are no external dependencies that need to be installed.
* **HeatmapR** is designed under ROpenSci naming guidelines for a consistent and intuitive user experience.
* unlike other heatmap packages that use base graphics, **HeatmapR** actually returns the plot object instead of an image. This makes it easy to arrange multiple plots in complex layouts without sacrificing resolution.
* **HeatmapR** is fully customizable and comes with useful saving API (`heat_map_save()`) to export high resolution images.
* **HeatmapR** handles datasets that contain non-numeric or missing data, which means you don't have to spend ages formatting and pre-processing the data.

## Installation

**HeatmapR** can be installed directly from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
devtools::install_github("DillonHammill/HeatmapR")
```

## Usage

Creating heatmaps is as easy as loading **HeatmapR** and supplying your dataset to the `heat_map()` function. For details on customising your heatmaps, refer to the package vignette.

```{r, eval =TRUE, echo = FALSE}
library(HeatmapR)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(HeatmapR)
heat_map(mtcars,
         scale = "range",
         dendrogram = "both")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
heat_map_save("man/figures/README-HeatmapR-1.png",
              height = 7,
              width = 10,
              res = 500)
heat_map(mtcars,
         scale = "range",
         dendrogram = "both")
```

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = '95%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/README-HeatmapR-1.png')
```
